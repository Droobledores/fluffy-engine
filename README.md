# Fluffy - The JavaScript/CSS framework
A JavaScript framework based on Bootstrap and Angular.

FYI, this was created instead of doing homework, so there will be bugs!
## Installing
You should be able to just copy and paste the files straight from the release zip. DO NOT INSTALL STRAIGHT FROM THE REPOSITORY, UNLESS YOU WANT THE NEWEST FEATURES.
## Contributing
