# Fluffy - The Angular/Bootstrap framework
A JavaScript/CSS framework based on Bootstrap and Angular.

FYI, this was created instead of doing homework, so there will be bugs!
## Installing
You should be able to just copy and paste the files straight from the release zip. DO NOT INSTALL STRAIGHT FROM THE REPOSITORY, UNLESS YOU WANT THE NEWEST FEATURES.
## TO-DO
- [ ] Combine bootstrap.min.css, angular.min.js, and NG-Bootstrap (If at all possible).
## Contributing
Feel free to contribute!
